# Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.
print "I could have code like this." # and the comment will be ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."

# Fun fact if # is inside quotes, like this: "#", it is part of a string
# and can be output with a print command
# try uncommenting the following line
# print "See we can print # inside a string"
